	"description" : "This mod adds a new secondary skill, learnable only by magic-class heroes, that lets their troops use supernatural energy in melee combat and gives +1 cast to their spellcasters. Low-tier creatures benefit from the former bonus the most. Additionally, artifacts that boost this skill further can be found or bought from the Bonepeddler, and equipped by the creatures themselves.
